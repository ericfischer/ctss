The reconstruction of the BCPL compiler for CTSS is still under
construction.

This directory will hold a modification of the BCPL compiler as it was
when running under CTSS at Project MAC. The original source listings
have dates between February and June 1968. This modification will be
able to compile the original compiler into FAP assembly language or
BSS. The modified version is designed to run under the current 64-bit
version of Cintcode BCPL. The modified compiler is in bcpl7094.b with
header file: bcpl7094.h.  It compiles BCPL programs to either FAP
assembly language or BSS.
