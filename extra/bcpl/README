This is the README file for the BCPLCTSS distribution.

Martin Richards (c) 17 November 2016

This distribution is still under development, but is getting on quite
well.

I have typed in the source code from IBM golf ball listing of the
compiler dating back to between February and June 1968.

Random notes

Files on CTSS are identified by two six character names.

This directory hold the source of the CTSS BPL Compiler dated about mid 1968.

A modified version that runs under the current 64-bit Cintcode BCPL
system is called bcpl7094.b and is in the directory bcpl7094/.

The FAP assembly language compilations will be held in directory FAP/
and the BSS compilations are in directory BSS/ but these use 12 digit
octal constants to represent each 36 bit word. The BSS cards are
represented by 28 36-bit words. I believe each word occupied three
columns of a card. I have not yet found a detailed specification of
BSS and so have not been able to check the correctness of the BSS
compilation.

Current the FAP translations have the corresponding OCODE statement
embedded as a debugging aid. They are non standard comments prefixed
with # characters in column one. They can be removed by deleting all
line starting with a # character, or by removing the option ocode from
the bctss script and recompiling using c compall.

The command command bctss will compile a section of the compiler and
compall will compile every section of the compiler.

The file BCPLCTSS/bcpl7094/xrefbcpl7094 is a cross reference listing
of bcpl7094.b

Be aware that you need the 64-bit version of Cintcode BCPL. This is
called cintsys64 and is created after Cintcode BCPL has been properly
installed using the command: make run64

Work is still in progress!
